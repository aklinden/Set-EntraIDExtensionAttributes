# Set-EntraIDExtensionAttributes.ps1

Populate EntraID computer extensionAttributes for Office, Department, and device type based on a devices location in the OU tree. And, because of the way that Autopilot creates objects in EntraID when a device is provisioned, an extension attribute for hybrid-joined or cloud only objects is created as well.

## Functions

- **`Get-ExtensionAttributes`**: 
  - Uses regex patterns to derive values for `Office`, `Department`, and `DeviceType` from an Active Directory computer object's `distinguishedName` property.
- **`Compare-ExtensionAttributes`**:
  - Compares the `extensionAttributes` in Entra ID with those generated by `Get-ExtensionAttributes`. If discrepancies are found, the EntraID object's attributes are updated.

- **PowerShell Version**: 5.1 or later.

  - `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
